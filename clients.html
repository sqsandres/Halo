            <h2> Penn State University Wilkes-Barre - Chem Lab</h2>
            <p>The ABE (Agricultural and Biological Engineering) Department had outgrown its antiquated facilities.
                Classroom, research, office, and conference room space was limited due to increased needs of the
                successful programs in the department. The original structures were built in 1937 and added on to in
                1968. One of the more challenging tasks of this project was to create a modern space which compliments
                the historic front portion of the original building.
                <br />
                <br />

                <br />
                <br />
                The Agriculture Engineering Building project is a complete renovation of an existing building plus a
                large building addition which will position the Department of Agriculture and Biological Engineering to
                achieve its vision of being an international leader in research, education and outreach.
                <br />
                <br />

                <h2> Penn State University - Whitmore Lab</h2>
                <p>Whitmore Lab serves over 7,500 students annually and is one of the primary lab facilities for the
                    university’s biology and chemistry departments. Built in 1953, the Whitmore lab, which houses
                    chemistry teaching labs, was redesigned to accommodate more students, processes, and equipment and
                    to improve the safety of the building’s infrastructure. Whitmore Lab was too small and outdated to
                    serve the departments’ space, safety, and technology needs.The Whitmore Laboratory renovation
                    project was a phased chemistry laboratory renovation / modernization project which revived the 60
                    plus year old laboratory building and transformed it into a state of the art teaching facility
                    poised to remain relevant for the next 40 years. The new labs not only provided state-of-the-art lab
                    space for students, but also optimized the buildings’ performance and created a safer and more
                    efficient learning environment.
                    Marx Sheet Metal and Mechanical was awarded the job as a sub to the project Mechanical Contractor. A
                    phased strategy that allowed for partial occupancy of the building during construction was
                    implemented.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The BIM process employed was crucial to the integration of the varied construction trades required
                    for the modernization upgrade. This renovation was highlighted by one of the largest single
                    laboratories constructed and interconnected with welded stainless-steel exhaust ductwork and a
                    series of large laboratory exhaust fans located on the roof. Due to the land locked nature of the
                    Whitmore Laboratory Building, the series of large lab exhaust fans were delivered to an off-site
                    location with each stack prefabricated with the help of a small hydraulic crane and then transported
                    to the site without interruption to the busy college campus and assembled on the roof with the help
                    of a large hydraulic crane.
                    This project is complete and currently in use by the University.</p>
                <br />
                <br />

                <h2> Chemical and Biomedical Engineering Building - Penn State University</h2>
                <p>The Chemical and Biological Engineering Building is a new building project including 5 stories, lower
                    level and mechanical penthouse. This large undertaking by the university will provide expanded
                    facilities needed to accommodate department growth, includes specialized chemical engineering
                    laboratories with student collaborative space and project-based education.
                    <br />

                    <br />
                    Although not part of the original design assist team for the project, Marx Sheet Metal & Mechanical
                    came on board with as a sub to the mechanical contractor and was quickly leveled up to work directly
                    for Barton Malow.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The extensive BIM process was transitioned to mechanical construction starting with the layout and
                    installation of deck inserts with two Trimble total stations prior to concrete being poured. Large
                    scale welded stainless steel (as well as galvanized steel) risers and main ducts runs soon followed.
                    The mechanical penthouse followed which included much inter-trade coordination highlighted by the
                    rigging and installation of six enormous air handlers and one heat recovery unit. Leak testing of
                    required risers, ducts and air handling equipment was self-performed as was the installation of two
                    large outside air plenums and one heat recovery plenum.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Branch ductwork, equipment installation and asset management is currently ongoing with a completion
                    date expected later this year.
                    Upon completion of this project Marx Sheet Metal & Mechanical will have installed over 600,000
                    pounds of ductwork (equivalent to the weight of a Boeing 777 airliner) including over 100,000 pounds
                    of welded stainless-steel ductwork.
                </p>

                <p>The ABE (Agricultural and Biological Engineering) Department had outgrown its antiquated facilities.
                    Classroom, research, office, and conference room space was limited due to increased needs of the

                    <br />
                    The Agriculture Engineering Building project is a complete renovation of an existing building plus a
                    large building addition which will position the Department of Agriculture and Biological Engineering
                    to achieve its vision of being an international leader in research, education and outreach.<br />
                    <br />
                    The Agricultural Engineering Building project was implemented through Integrated Project Delivery
                    (IPD). This was the first Penn State major project being handled through this approach. all
                    participants were in on the project as a team from the beginning – including the customer (ABE and
                    Penn State), the architects, the engineers, the contractors. This greatly increased the
                    communications and the efficiency of the project from the very beginning.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The IPD process employed and BIM activities were the basis of integrating the renovation / addition
                    efforts in a cohesive construction process. A wide variety of ductwork and materials for air supply,
                    return and exhaust systems including laboratory hoods, snorkels and point of use exhausts plus both
                    laboratory exhaust and utility fan sets highlight the well-integrated architectural and mechanical
                    construction efforts.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    This project is complete and the university will be using this building starting in June.</p>
