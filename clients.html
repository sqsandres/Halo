            <h2> Penn State University Wilkes-Barre - Chem Lab</h2>
            <p>The ABE (Agricultural and Biological Engineering) Department had outgrown its antiquated facilities.
            Classroom, research, office, and conference room space was limited due to increased needs of the
            successful programs in the department. The original structures were built in 1937 and added on to in
            1968. One of the more challenging tasks of this project was to create a modern space which compliments
            the historic front portion of the original building.

            <br />
            The Agriculture Engineering Building project is a complete renovation of an existing building plus a                large building addition which will position the Department of Agriculture and Biological Engineering to
            achieve its vision of being an international leader in research, education and outreach.
            <br />
            <br />

            <h2> Penn State University - Whitmore Lab</h2>
            <p>Whitmore Lab serves over 7,500 students annually and is one of the primary lab facilities for the university’s biology and chemistry departments.                Built in 1953, the Whitmore lab, which houses chemistry teaching labs, was redesigned to accommodate more students, processes, and equipment and to improve the safety of the building’s infrastructure. Whitmore Lab was too small and outdated to serve the departments’ space, safety, and technology needs.The Whitmore Laboratory renovation project was a phased chemistry laboratory renovation / modernization project which revived the 60 plus year old laboratory building and transformed it into a state of the art teaching facility poised to remain relevant for the next 40 years. The new labs not only provided state-of-the-art lab space for students, but also optimized the buildings’ performance and created a safer and more efficient learning environment.
            Marx Sheet Metal and Mechanical was awarded the job as a sub to the project Mechanical Contractor.   A phased strategy that allowed for partial occupancy of the building during construction was implemented.
            <br />
            <br />
            The BIM process employed was crucial to the integration of the varied construction trades required for the modernization upgrade.  This renovation was highlighted by one of the largest single laboratories constructed and interconnected with welded stainless-steel exhaust ductwork and a series of large laboratory exhaust fans located on the roof.  Due to the land locked nature of the Whitmore Laboratory Building, the series of large lab exhaust fans were delivered to an off-site location with each stack prefabricated with the help of a small hydraulic crane and then transported to the site without interruption to the busy college campus and assembled on the roof with the help of a large hydraulic crane.    
            This project is complete and currently in use by the University.</p>
            <br />
            <br />

            <h2> Chemical and Biomedical Engineering Building - Penn State University</h2>
            <p>The Chemical and Biological Engineering Building is a new building project including 5 stories, lower level and mechanical penthouse.  This large undertaking by the university will provide expanded facilities needed to accommodate department growth, includes specialized chemical engineering laboratories with student collaborative space and project-based education.
            <br />
            
            <br />
            Although not part of the original design assist team for the project, Marx Sheet Metal & Mechanical came on board with as a sub to the mechanical contractor and was quickly leveled up to work directly for Barton Malow. 
            <br /> 
            <br />
           The extensive BIM process was transitioned to mechanical construction starting with the layout and installation of deck inserts with two Trimble total stations prior to concrete being poured.  Large scale welded stainless steel (as well as galvanized steel) risers and main ducts runs soon followed.  The mechanical penthouse followed which included much inter-trade coordination highlighted by the rigging and installation of six enormous air handlers and one heat recovery unit.  Leak testing of required risers, ducts and air handling equipment was self-performed as was the installation of two large outside air plenums and one heat recovery plenum.   
            <br />
            <br />
            Branch ductwork, equipment installation and asset management is currently ongoing with a completion date expected later this year.                 
            Upon completion of this project Marx Sheet Metal & Mechanical will have installed over 600,000 pounds of ductwork (equivalent to the weight of a Boeing 777 airliner) including over 100,000 pounds of welded stainless-steel ductwork.

            <h2> Penn State University - Agricultural Engineering Building </h2>
            <p>The ABE (Agricultural and Biological Engineering) Department had outgrown its antiquated facilities. 
                Classroom, research, office, and conference room space was limited due to increased needs of the successful programs in the department. 
                The original structures were built in 1937 and added on to in 1968.  
                One of the more challenging tasks of this project was to create a modern space which compliments the historic front portion of the original building.
            <br />
            <br />
            The Agriculture Engineering Building project is a complete renovation of an existing building plus a large building addition which will position the Department of Agriculture and Biological Engineering to achieve its vision of being an international leader in research, education and outreach.<br />
            <br />
            The Agricultural Engineering Building project was implemented through Integrated Project Delivery (IPD).  This was the first Penn State major project being handled through this approach.  all participants were in on the project as a team from the beginning – including the customer (ABE and Penn State), the architects, the engineers, the contractors.  This greatly increased the communications and the efficiency of the project from the very beginning.
            <br />
            <br />
            The IPD process employed and BIM activities were the basis of integrating the renovation / addition efforts in a cohesive construction process.  A wide variety of ductwork and materials for air supply, return and exhaust systems including laboratory hoods, snorkels and point of use exhausts plus both laboratory exhaust and utility fan sets highlight the well-integrated architectural and mechanical construction efforts.
            <br />
            <br />
            This project is complete and the university will be using this building starting in June.</p>
